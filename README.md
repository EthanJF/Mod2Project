# Module 2 Project: Fantasy Stock Market
###### Project completed as part of Flatiron School curriculum.

#### project by Ethan Fournier and Reina Mitchell


## Project FAQ
#### 1. What is Fantasy Stock Market?
A mini stock market simulator, where users battle each other through their stock portfolios.


#### 2. How does it work?
After creating an account, users can buy stocks to grow their total net worth. Afterwards, that user can see other users' accounts and decide to battle them. Battling other investors means your portfolio goes head to head with theirs and who ever has the better portfolio wins.


## Deliverables
1.	Create a fully functioning website using Rails.
2.	Build user authentication and authorization.
3.	Build a database schema (using Postgres) with a minimum of five models.
4.	Create at least twenty methods across models.
5.	Do not use Javascript (since next learning module is dedicated to Javascript).

#### Time allocated: 4 days
